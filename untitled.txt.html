ne solution would be to do it with globalCompositeOperation as Daniel says in his answer:

//set-up - probably only needs to be done once
var scratchCanvas = document.createElement('canvas');
scratchCanvas.width = 100;
scratchCanvas.height = 100;
var scratchCtx = scratchCanvas.getContext('2d');


//drawing code
scratchCtx.clearRect(0, 0, scratchCanvas.width, scratchCanvas.height);

scratchCtx.globalCompositeOperation = 'source-over'; //default

//Do whatever drawing you want. In your case, draw your image.
scratchCtx.drawImage(imageToCrop, ...);


//As long as we can represent our clipping region as a single path, 
//we can perform our clipping by using a non-default composite operation.
//You can think of destination-in as "write alpha". It will not touch
//the color channel of the canvas, but will replace the alpha channel.
//(Actually, it will multiply the already drawn alpha with the alpha
//currently being drawn - meaning that things look good where two anti-
//aliased pixels overlap.)
//
//If you can't represent the clipping region as a single path, you can
//always draw your clip shape into yet another scratch canvas.

scratchCtx.fillStyle = '#fff'; //color doesn't matter, but we want full opacity
scratchCtx.globalCompositeOperation = 'destination-in';
scratchCtx.beginPath();
scratchCtx.arc(50, 50, 50, 0, 2 * Math.PI, true);
scratchCtx.closePath();
scratchCtx.fill();


//Now that we have a nice, cropped image, we can draw it in our
//actual canvas. We can even draw it over top existing pixels, and
//everything will look great!

ctx.drawImage(scratchCanves, ...);




















if (_width>=_height) {
    /**
    * @wide
   */
   if (_innerHeight > _innerWidth ) {
   zoom = _innerWidth / (_width * padding)
} else {
   zoom = _innerHeight / (_width * padding)
}
}else{
   /**
    * @long
   */
  if (_width>_innerHeight && _innerHeight>_innerWidth) {
      zoom = _innerWidth / (_height *( padding))
   } else {
       zoom = _innerHeight / (_height *( padding))
       console.log(zoom);
}
}
